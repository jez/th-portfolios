This is a simple app that allows participants to upload a resume alongside other profile information, as well as allows for sponsors to download resumes.

## Local development
Assuming you already have node.js and heroku tools installed, you can do the following steps to get this working locally.
- Clone the git repo using the link on the right hand side.
- From the cloned directory, run `npm install` to get the node dependencies
- Ask me for the MongoLab URI key which you will need to set in an environment variable named `THACKS_MONGOLAB_URI`
- use `foreman start` to run the node server
- Hope that everything works.
- Complain to me when inevitably I gave you the wrong instructions.

And by following those steps exactly, you should have no trouble setting everything up.
